Its body is enveloped in a soft, glowing aura that shifts colors based on its mood. Delicate, wing-like appendages that seem more magical than physical allow it to hover. Feeblecast is known for its ability to sense and manipulate emotions, often using its powers to calm conflict, though it struggles in physical confrontations due to its fragile nature.

- **HP:** 55
- **Attack:** 40
- **Defense:** 60
- **Special Attack:** 95
- **Special Defense:** 105
- **Speed:** 90

**Abilities:**
- **Mystic Veil (Primary Ability):** Creates a protective aura that reduces the damage of incoming attacks.
- **Hidden Ability: Serene Focus:** Prevents Feeblecast from being affected by moves that fluster it or cause confusion.

**Notable Moves:**
- **Mystic Wave:** A special Psychic/Fairy type move that can confuse the target.
- **Aura Shield:** Boosts Feeblecast's Special Defense temporarily.
- **Emotion Pulse:** A move that changes effectiveness based on Feeblecast‚Äôs mood.
